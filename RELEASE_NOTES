R1.6.0:           Marcio Donadio, 02/15/2017
                  Creating new release R1.6.0 to avoid confusion w/ prior pcds R1-5* releases

ADSupport-R1-5-1: Updated event module version to Event-R4-2-0

ADSupport-R1-5-0: Imported plugin commands and databases from ADStream (PDCS). These
                  commands are used by AD based IOCs to configure the plugins.
		  Fifo timestamp should not be used in this version
		  ADCore version set to ADCore-R2-1_1-0

ADSupport-R1-4-1: Remove debugging message from Gaussian Fitting in NDStats2 plugin

ADSupport-R1-4-0: Support new plugin: NDStats2 plugin
                  - introduce intensity threshold high to cutout local peaks in beam bundle
                  for centroid calculation
                  - introduce Gaussian fitting for beam position

ADSupport-R1-3-0: Support for FIFO timestamping - improvement over the pipeline
		  tagging introduced in version R1-1-1. This has been tested
		  with the Prosilica GX1050 only.

ADSupport-R1-2-0: Support for PULSEID waveform record

ADSupport-R1-1-1: Changed Pipeline tagging to use elapsed time between triggers
		  to define whether the camera is triggering at 120 Hz. Sollely
		  checking whether event 140 is the source of the trigger is 
		  not enough. The actual beam rate may be lower than 120 Hz,
		  and in this case the timestamping implemented in version
		  ADSupport-R1-1-0 would save wrong PULSEIDs.

ADSupport-R1-1-0: Added support to tag images that are one PULSEID late when
		  running at 120 Hz (event 140).

ADSupport-R1-0-0: Initial port from old areaDetectorSupport to use with ADCore
                  timeStampSourceLib for ADCore, axisTicks support for profile monitors
