ADSupport-R1-1-1: Changed Pipeline tagging to use elapsed time between triggers
		  to define whether the camera is triggering at 120 Hz. Sollely
		  checking whether event 140 is the source of the trigger is 
		  not enough. The actual beam rate may be lower than 120 Hz,
		  and in this case the timestamping implemented in version
		  ADSupport-R1-1-0 would save wrong PULSEIDs.

ADSupport-R1-1-0: Added support to tag images that are one PULSEID late when
		  running at 120 Hz (event 140).

ADSupport-R1-0-0: Initial port from old areaDetectorSupport to use with ADCore
                  timeStampSourceLib for ADCore, axisTicks support for profile monitors
